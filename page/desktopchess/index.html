        <sup><i>To the chess nerds: I was messing around with the program. The blunders in the game were simply disregarded for showcasing purposes. You are not Stockfish, you have no rights to complain about mistakes in the game. In fact, you chess players will watch a match between players under 400 elo and refuse to eat, sleep, or shower- Oh wait! You never showered in the first place!</i></sup>
