        <i>19 Aug 2023</i>
        <p>As you might have read the title, the reason for this is that the increasingly complex and hard-to-use development environment of some of my projects, like <a href="https://temp-anywhere.vercel.app/">Temperature Anywhere</a> as I expand it.</p>
        <p>Before this, I would experiment with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS (and sometimes some libraries, but the foundation is JS in the browser). After that, these websites are simply deployed on GitHub Pages. Now, I have became more aware of more intricate tech stacks involving frameworks like React, and things aren't simple anymore (skill issue). Managing and deploying the websites is another problem. Tools like Vite and Vercel did make it easier, but I still cannot make the development environment stable.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately the existing projects' code are already wrecked and I find no motivation to fix them, so they will be left as they are. Nevertheless, I am looking forward to improve my future codebases and utilize version control to make them eligible for open-sourcing, not an abhorent hideous mess that can't be run locally.</p>
